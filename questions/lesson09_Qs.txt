1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Very comfortable.

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

Nothing really. I thought the lesson/app were pretty clear.

3) Give an application of the lesson for your area of study.

Not sure if I will use this since the text looks really busy, but I might if I am working with a smaller dataset.

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

None specific to text plots but a gradient visualization that I'm interested in is heatmaps.
