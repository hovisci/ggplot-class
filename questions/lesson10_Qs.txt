1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Moderate. I've used the grid function before but only with 2 plots.

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

I struggled with understanding how to use matrices to detremine the panel layout. 
For example, in the last plot, is there a way to center the middle plot on the right?
Right now it's not the most attractive layout.

3) Give an application of the lesson for your area of study.

I have used this before to show differences of land cover between to time points.

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

It would be cool to create a animation of the changes. I'm looking forward to learning that.
