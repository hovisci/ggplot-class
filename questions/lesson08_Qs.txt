1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Pretty comfortable.

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

There was no "season" variable in the df so the part 2 plot did not work for me.
I also struggled a little with the weather type vector as well and had to rely on the answer key a lot more than previous lessons

3) Give an application of the lesson for your area of study.

Helpful for displaying multiple categories in one bar plot, and will likely use.

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

Do you have a good resource for the different ggplot parameters? Or does it just come with experience?
For example, I would not have known how to but the bars side by side using the code w/o exntensive googling:
 position=after_stat(position_nudge(x=-0.2))
