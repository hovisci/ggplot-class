1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Very comfortable

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

Nothing.

I liked messing withthe themes. I typically don't pay attention to them and go with a default.

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

What are the differnt text families again? Is there a link or resource for the different fonts available?
Something similar to the R Colors document since I don't know what "mono" font looks like off the top of my head.

If you are in Microsoft Word, the text families is the same as the font list. If the font exists in Word then you can theoretically use it in R.  But, using anything beyond the 4 or 5 fonts in R is quite challenging. I have not found a reasonable way to teach this yet...
