1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Very comfortable

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

Figuring out the coordinates of the annotation always gives me trouble and I do a lot of trial and error.

Yeah, even when you get coordinates right, the spacing can get awkward! 

3) Give an application of the lesson for your area of study.

Useful for creating visualization categories/directions for mapping, not just boxpltos.

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

Something other than boxplot  
Lesson 8 move on to other material...
