Lesson 2 Questions

What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?
- Very comfortable with this lesson's material.

What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?
- None. I felt like the instructions were very clear.

What is a way you can apply the material in this lesson towards your research or area of study?
- It will be generally useful for basic plots. I also had never used a reference script before so I'll be using that as a tool going forward.

What are some things you would like to learn related to, but not covered in, this lesson?
- I'm curious if you can create a "theme" once and apply it to multiple datasets/plots. Rather than having multiple lines dictating the same component characterictics for different plots.
