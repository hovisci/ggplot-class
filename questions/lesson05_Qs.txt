1) What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

Very comfortable

2) What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

"facet" and what it actually does
Also not exactly sure what "~" and "." mean in the coding context
 
    facet_grid( facet= biMonth ~ .)
    
    The ~ separates the x and y axis (y-axis first) 
    The . is sort of a placeholder that says "do nothing" because we
    do not want to facet the x-axis.  This is not a common way in 
    programming to say "do nothing" -- just the way it is done here
    
    So, the line is saying to:
    - create multiple plots on the y-axis using biMonth to
      factor your y variable (in this example, y is humidity count)
    - do nothing special on the x-axis 
    
 
3) Give an application of the lesson for your area of study.

I plot data for differnt countries all of the time, so I was actually using 
"facet" the other day to compare frequencies of a categorical variable

4) Give an extension to the material that you would like to see.

More detail/working with "facet"

There are more examples coming!
